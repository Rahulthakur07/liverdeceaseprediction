# Liver decease prediction

Objective:
	Given a set of data, our main aim is to analyse it for each and every patient and determine whether or not He/She suffers from liver disease. In order to achieve this, we have used 4 models:
  
    Na√Øve Bayes Model 
    The Logistic Regression Model	
    K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Model
    Support Vector Machine(SVM)
    
 Reasons for choice of algorithms:

    All are Supervised Classification Methods and are classified based on features.

    Naive Bayes : It is very simple to implement. When assumption of independence holds, a Naive Bayes classifier performs better compared to other models like logistic regression and you need less training data.  

    KNN : The K-nearest neighbor algorithm is that is simple to understand and easy to implement. With zero to little training time

    Logistic Regression : Based on probabilistic results.

    SVM : It works really well with clear margin of separation
